#REQUIREMENT : 
Create 3 objects: object A , Object B, Object C,

- C with lookup field to B

- B with lookup field to A

- Create record page for object A and add a lightning component to show a custom related list where it shows a table with all records of object B and C without any distinction
- Needs to be scalable for a huge number of records and don't forget limits. You can use pagination or infinite scrolling, as you prefer.
- To deliver: package ready to be deployed with all metadata that you created

# we will use Aura cmp with Lightning Related List Filter

This solution is a lightning component which mimimic the look and feel with the out of box related list but give you more control on:

1. You can apply filter of your choice on the related list.
2. You are not limited to child object but any grand-child object as long as it can reference back to the parent.
3. You can specify the title of the related list that is meaningful to you.
4. You are not limited to only four fields to show.
5. You are not limited to 6 records but have more control on how many records you want to show,
6. You don't have to show the ugly bar code for you child object.
7. You can choose from display types of List or Tile.

we can now add Related list on Object A record page that will contain a table of related object B and object C.

1. Text

### Key Attributes

This field is used in the SOQL after FROM Clause. This is the API name of your related object, be careful with the letter case, it matters when you try to create a related record. It supports custom objects as well.
##### Example 1: Object B
